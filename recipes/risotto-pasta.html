        <h2>A unique take on making pasta in the italian risotto style</h2>
        <p>Risotto is popular around the world, and so is pasta. Combining these two gives you a quick, easy weeknight meal that you can make in 20 minutes or less.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>150g Spinach or Broccoli Rabbe</li>
            <li>200g Ground Italian Sausage or Chicken</li>
            <li>250g Tube-Style Pasta (Penne, Macaroni, etc.)</li>
            <li>150g Parmesan or Pecorino Cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <li>Cook the sausage in a wide pot. Try to get as much brown fond as possible.</li>
            <li>Add the spinach and use the water to deglaze the pot and wilt the spinach.</li>
            <li>Remove the Spinach and Sausage.</li>
            <li>Add the Pasta, and allow it to toast in the hot pan for a moment. Do not allow the pan to scorch.</li>
            <li>Cover the Pasta with water, but do not overfill the pot.</li>
            <li>Cook the pasta while stirring and adding water slowly, if necessary.</li>
            <li>When the pasta is finished, add back the Spinach and Sausage, and turn off the heat. Stir everything to combine well.</li>
            <li>Add the cheese slowly while stirring aggresively to make an emulsion.</li>
            <li>Serve.</li>
